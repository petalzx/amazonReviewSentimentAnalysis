# amazonReviewSentimentAnalysis

This is a sentiment analysis project that processes text data from Amazon reviews to determine the emotion of a review. 
Reviews are given a positive, neutral, negative score using nltk's VADER sentiment analysis toolkit. 
Exploratory data analysis was then performed on the results to measure a correlation between the emotion of a particular review and its star rating (1-5).
The program uses a standard Amazon review dataframe. 

# Installation
